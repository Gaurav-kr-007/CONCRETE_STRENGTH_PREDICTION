# CONCRETE_STRENGTH_PREDICTION
The project aims to determine compressive strength of concrete ,which is depending on various elements like cement,water,flyash etc.

Analysed datasets taken from kaggle website and performed feature engineering like scaling,transformation.
Used different python lib like pandas,matplotlib for visualisation and sklearn.

Applied different regression model like linear regression,ridge,lasso and randomforest regressior.
Achieved highest accuracy with randomforest regressior.

Any suggestions are welcomed.
